1.0.3

* If you get killed by a monster in PvP arenas (no XP loss, no Soul Sickness), you can now visit a Soul Healer and ask for Soul Healing. It will now unconditionally clear your "You must visit a Soul Healer" state and allow the app to continue to function without restarting.
* Added display of player's character level (if entered)

1.0.2
* Fixed XP chart for level 57-59
* If starting AP was not entered during startup, the player will no longer be prompted to manually input AP, during soul healing or manual EXP update, if player had been attacked by another player

1.0.1

* Fixed XP chart for level 54-56
* When you are on the fast track server and hit 100% XP at level 55, Grind Meter will now properly hold level and EXP at 55 and 100% respectively, instead of incorrectly recognize a level up to 56.
